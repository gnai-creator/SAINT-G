# Phase 16 Marco 4H - Fine-Grained Second Stage

Status: **implemented, dry-run validated**.

## Goal

Marco 4G improved G1 but still rejected G2:

```text
accepted_grafts: 4
stage 2: rejected
```

Marco 4H tests whether the second stage fails because the remaining useful
updates are smaller than a 4-graft group.

## Method

The routed benchmark now supports:

```text
--post-first-stage-size
```

Behavior:

```text
stage 1: use --stage-size
stage 2+: use --post-first-stage-size
```

This keeps the best known first-stage shape while allowing G2 and later stages
to grow one or two grafts at a time.

Acceptance remains strict:

```text
approve only if candidate_composed_loss improves previous_composed_loss
```

## Dry-Run

Run:

```text
runs/phase16_marco4h_adaptive_stage_dryrun
```

Result:

```text
marco: 4h_fine_grained_second_stage
stage 1 size: 2
stage 2 size: 1
recompose_abs_diff: 0.0
```

The dry-run used permissive acceptance only to validate that adaptive stage
sizing, checkpoint composition, and target maps work.

  --candidate-activations silu
```

This tests the best known G1 pattern, then probes smaller follow-up grafts.

## Criteria

Marco 4H passes if:

```text
composed_loss < 10.414729
accepted_grafts > 4
recompose_abs_diff = 0.0
```

Strong pass:

```text
accepted_grafts >= 6
no composed regression
```

## 24-Graft Result

Run:

```

Result:

| metric | value |
|---|---:|
| base_loss | 10.416174 |
| composed_loss | 10.414671 |
| accumulated_gain | 0.001504 |
| accepted_groups | 2 |
| accepted_grafts | 5 |
| recompose_abs_diff | 0.0 |

Stage summary:

| stage | grafts | target | lr | init_scale | decision | gain |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | 0-3 | blocks.2 | 3e-8 | 0.01 | approved | 0.001450 |
| 2 | 4 | blocks.3 | 1e-7 | 0.01 | approved | 0.000054 |
| 3 | 5 | blocks.1 | 3e-8 | 0.001 | rejected | 0.000000 |

Comparison:

```text
Marco 4G light gain: 0.001446
Marco 4H gain:       0.001504
extra gain:          ~0.000058
```

Verdict:

```text
Marco 4H passed.
```

The result shows that G2 was not impossible. The previous `stage_size=4` was too
coarse after G1. Reducing follow-up stages to one graft allowed the router to
accept an additional graft on `blocks.3` without composed regression.

The next bottleneck is stage 3. After five accepted grafts, the current local
grid again fails to find a positive composed gain.
