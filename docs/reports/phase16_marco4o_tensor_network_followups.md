# Phase 16 Marco 4O - Tensor-Network Follow-ups from ITensors.jl and NTK-Mirror

Status: **design documented; 4O-lite SVD anatomy completed for 4N-B seeds 42, 7, and 123**.

This document records the technical ideas extracted from two external projects and maps them to concrete SAINT-G and DRM Transformer follow-up work:

- **ITensors.jl / ITensorMPS.jl**: tensor-network abstractions, named indices, SVD/truncation discipline, MPS/MPO methods, contraction-cost analysis, block-sparse tensor structure.
- **NTK-Mirror**: LoRA-free forward-pass adaptation through sparse signed activation log-gates, NTK-style gate selection, and log-gate composability.

The purpose is not to add heavy external dependencies to SAINT-G. The purpose is to preserve the useful algorithmic ideas and convert them into PyTorch-native diagnostics and baselines that fit the existing Phase 16 graft-routing pipeline.

## Executive Verdict

ITensors.jl is valuable for SAINT-G mostly as a source of tensor-network design patterns, not as a direct runtime dependency.

```text
Do not integrate Julia/ITensors.jl directly into the current Phase 16 loop.
Do borrow its tensor-network ideas and implement minimal PyTorch probes/baselines.
```

NTK-Mirror is closer to the current SAINT-G Phase 16 work because Marco 4M already implements an NTK-Mirror-inspired activation-gradient score:

```text
score(target) = sum(abs(grad_h * h))
```

However, SAINT-G should still treat NTK-Mirror as an inspiration and baseline family rather than a drop-in replacement. NTK-Mirror gates activation channels. SAINT-G graft blocks add trainable modules and validate staged model growth under a recomposable checkpoint protocol.

## Source Projects Reviewed

### ITensors.jl

Repository:

```text
https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl
```

ITensors.jl is a Julia library for tensor-network algorithms. Its core abstractions are tensors with named/tagged indices whose semantics are separated from their memory layout. This makes tensor contraction and factorization less error-prone because index identity, tags, and prime levels carry structural information.

Important features for SAINT-G:

```text
- ITensor indices with tags and identities;
- dense and block-sparse tensor support;
- QN / conserved-quantity indexing;
- tensor contraction by index identity;
- contraction sequence cost and optimization;
- SVD, QR, eigen/factorization on arbitrary tensor index groupings;
- truncated SVD with cutoff, maxdim, mindim, and truncation-error reporting;
- GPU backends through Julia GPU packages, with dense CUDA/cuTENSOR support more mature than block-sparse GPU paths.
```

Since ITensors.jl v0.7, MPS/MPO functionality moved out of ITensors.jl into ITensorMPS.jl.

### ITensorMPS.jl

Repository:

```text
https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorMPS.jl
```

ITensorMPS.jl contains the finite MPS/MPO algorithms and types that are most directly relevant to tensor-train adapter baselines:

```text
- MPS and MPO types;
- random_mps;
- OpSum -> MPO construction;
- DMRG;
- truncate!;
- maxlinkdim;
- inner / dot / loginner;
- apply and gate evolution utilities.
```

For SAINT-G, the most important transferable idea is not DMRG itself. It is the controlled representation of high-order objects as low-bond-dimension tensor networks, with explicit truncation and error accounting.

### NTK-Mirror

Repository:

```text
https://github.com/leochlon/ntkmirror
```

NTK-Mirror learns sparse signed log-gates on frozen Transformer decoder-layer output channels:

```text
h'_{layer, token, channel} = exp(s_{layer, channel}) * h_{layer, token, channel}
```

Gate selection is based on a log-gate derivative:

```text
dL/ds_{l,c} = sum_t <dL/dh_{l,t,c}, h_{l,t,c}>
```

The public package fits small controllers, saves them as `controller.pt`, attaches them during evaluation/generation, and composes task controllers in signed log-gate coordinates:

```text
s_AB = clip(w_A * s_A + w_B * s_B, -max_log_gate, max_log_gate)
h'   = exp(s_AB) * h
```

This directly inspired SAINT-G Marco 4M's activation-gradient target score. The difference is that Marco 4M currently uses the score as a diagnostic/routing signal for graft targets, while NTK-Mirror trains the activation gates themselves as the adaptation mechanism.

## Why Direct ITensors.jl Integration Is Not Recommended Now

SAINT-G and DRM Transformer are currently PyTorch projects. Adding ITensors.jl would introduce:

```text
- a Julia runtime dependency;
- cross-language tensor conversion complexity;
- duplicated GPU-memory management concerns;
- a separate package/environment story;
- extra failure modes during long CUDA benchmark runs;
- little immediate benefit for Phase 16 routing, which can use PyTorch SVD and hooks directly.
```

The current practical path is:

```text
ITensors.jl idea -> PyTorch implementation -> SAINT-G report/run artifact
```

Only revisit a Julia bridge if a later experiment specifically requires ITensorMPS.jl algorithms that are hard to reproduce in PyTorch.

## Relationship to Current Phase 16 State

The current Phase 16 sequence established:

```text
4H: best prior fine-grained second-stage result, 5 grafts.
4I: residual/orthogonal routing variant, 5 grafts, slightly worse than 4H.
4J: two-pass candidate pruning, valid CUDA run, but accepted only 4 grafts.
4K: larger top-k/probe variant documented to recover missed useful targets.
4L: multiseed robustness follow-up for 4K-style behavior.
4M: implemented NTK-Mirror-inspired activation-gate probe.
4N: planned NTK-guided candidate pruning/routing if 4M is predictive.
```

The ITensor-inspired work should come after the 4M/4N decision, because it answers a different question:

```text
After the routing chooses useful grafts, how much structured capacity do those grafts actually need?
```

That makes the next recommended tensor-network follow-up:

```text
Marco 4O-lite - Graft SVD Anatomy
```

4O-lite has now been executed and documented:

```text
docs/reports/phase16_marco4o_lite_graft_svd_anatomy.md
runs/phase16_marco4o_lite_graft_svd_seed42_seed7_seed123_effective/graft_svd_anatomy.md
```

Short result: accepted `up` matrices remain full-rank-like (`rank@99% = 95/96` on average), accepted `down` matrices are moderately concentrated (`rank@99% ~= 19.8`), and the linearized diagnostic product `up @ down` is strongly low-rank-looking (`rank@99% ~= 2.8`). Therefore 4O-lite supports a controlled low-rank baseline sweep, not blind truncation of the current full graft blocks.

and then, only if compression signals are strong:

```text
Marco 4O - Tensor-Train / MPS Adapter Baseline
```

## Idea 1 - Graft SVD Anatomy

### Motivation

ITensors.jl emphasizes factorization and controlled truncation. A direct SAINT-G translation is to analyze trained graft weights by singular spectrum and truncation error.

The key question:

```text
Are accepted graft blocks using their full capacity, or are they mostly low-rank?
```

If accepted grafts are highly compressible, SAINT-G can use smaller low-rank or tensor-train adapters. If not, graft-block capacity is justified, and the spectra become a diagnostic rather than a compression path.

### Proposed Marco

```text
Marco 4O-lite - Graft SVD Anatomy
```

### Scope

Create a script:

```text
scripts/analyze_phase16_graft_svd.py
```

Inputs:

```text
--checkpoint /path/to/composed_graft_checkpoint.pt
--stage-metrics /path/to/stage_metrics.json
--candidate-metrics /path/to/candidate_metrics.json
--output-dir /path/to/svd_report
```

Outputs:

```text
svd_metrics.json
singular_spectra.jsonl
rank_summary.csv
results.md
plots/*.png        # optional if matplotlib is available
```

### Metrics

For every trained/accepted graft matrix that can be extracted:

```text
- matrix name;
- shape;
- parameter count;
- Frobenius norm;
- singular values;
- cumulative energy curve;
- effective_rank_99;
- effective_rank_999;
- effective_rank_9999;
- stable rank = ||W||_F^2 / ||W||_2^2;
- entropy effective rank;
- truncation error at ranks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64;
- reconstruction error if the matrix is truncated and reinserted offline.
```

Recommended truncation-error formula:

```text
relative_truncation_error(k) = sum_{i>k} sigma_i^2 / sum_i sigma_i^2
```

This mirrors ITensors.jl's truncated-SVD discipline while staying in PyTorch.

### Comparisons

Compare spectra across:

```text
- accepted grafts vs rejected candidates if candidate checkpoints exist;
- seed 42 vs seed 7 vs seed 123;
- targets blocks.2 / blocks.3 / blocks.4;
- early accepted grafts vs the fifth graft;
- runs that find the fifth graft vs runs that stop at four grafts.
```

### Success Criteria

Marco 4O-lite is useful if it yields at least one actionable result:

```text
1. accepted grafts are low-rank enough to justify compression;
2. accepted and rejected grafts have visibly different spectra;
3. the fifth graft has a distinct rank/energy signature;
4. seed-robust runs show more stable spectra than seed-fragile runs;
5. truncation preserves loss within an acceptable tolerance.
```

### Failure Criteria

```text
- spectra are flat and not compressible;
- accepted and rejected grafts look indistinguishable;
- extracting matrices from checkpoints is unreliable;
- offline truncated reconstruction changes composed loss too much;
- analysis cost is high compared to insight gained.
```

## Idea 2 - Tensor-Train / MPS Adapter Baseline

### Motivation

ITensorMPS.jl suggests representing large structured transformations as chains of smaller tensors with a bounded internal bond dimension. In machine-learning terms, this maps to Tensor Train (TT) or MPS-style layers.

For SAINT-G, the baseline would ask:

```text
Can a low-bond-dimension tensor-network adapter match or beat graft blocks under the same routing protocol?
```

### Proposed Marco

```text
Marco 4O - Tensor-Train / MPS Adapter Baseline
```

### Design

Implement a PyTorch-native adapter, not a Julia bridge:

```text
TTLinear
TTGraftBlock
```

Candidate structure:

```text
input x: [batch, seq, d_model]
reshape channel axis into tensorized dimensions: d_model = prod(input_dims)
apply TT/MPS factorized transform with bond_dim chi
reshape back to [batch, seq, d_model]
add residual adapter output into the target block
```

For DRM's current 5M-scale configuration, `d_model` may not factor nicely. The implementation should support padding or a learned projection into a tensorized adapter width:

```text
x -> project_down -> TT/MPS core transform -> project_up -> residual add
```

This avoids forcing `d_model` itself to have a convenient factorization.

### Sweep

Start with small bond dimensions:

```text
bond_dim / chi: 2, 4, 8, 16
adapter_width: 64, 128, 256 if projection is used
activation: silu
initialization scale: match current graftblock candidates
```

### Comparison Axes

Compare against graft blocks under the existing Phase 16 routing protocol:

```text
- composed_loss;
- accepted_grafts;
- validation gain per parameter;
- validation gain per byte of checkpoint;
- training time;
- peak GPU memory;
- recompose_abs_diff;
- seed robustness;
- whether the fifth useful adaptation appears.
```

### Success Criteria

```text
- TT/MPS adapter reaches similar loss with fewer trainable parameters;
- TT/MPS adapter gives smaller checkpoint artifacts;
- TT/MPS adapter is more seed-robust than graft blocks;
- TT/MPS adapter recovers the fifth graft behavior without larger candidate probes.
```

### Failure Criteria

```text
- TT/MPS adapter underfits at practical bond dimensions;
- training is slower due to inefficient tensor contractions;
- parameter savings do not translate into better loss/byte/time;
- routing behavior becomes less stable than graft blocks.
```

## Idea 3 - Tensor-Network Cost as a Routing Feature

ITensors.jl includes contraction-cost analysis and contraction sequence optimization. SAINT-G can borrow this idea at the routing level.

Current routed candidates are mostly evaluated by validation gain and penalties. A future 4N/4P score could include an estimated capacity/runtime/memory term:

```text
candidate_score = gain
                - lambda_runtime * estimated_runtime_cost
                - lambda_memory  * estimated_memory_cost
                - lambda_params  * trainable_parameter_cost
                + alpha_ntk      * ntk_score_norm
```

The goal is not to compute an exact tensor-network contraction plan for PyTorch modules. The goal is to make routing aware that two candidates with similar gain may have different downstream cost profiles.

### Candidate Features

```text
- target block index;
- candidate parameter count;
- estimated activation memory;
- estimated FLOPs per forward/backward;
- adapter checkpoint bytes;
- NTK activation score;
- target redundancy/overlap with existing accepted grafts;
- SVD effective-rank signature if available.
```

### Practical Use

This would become useful after 4M/4O-lite because those reports can supply additional routing features:

```text
4M -> activation-gradient sensitivity
4O-lite -> compressibility / rank signature
4O -> cost of TT/MPS adapter family
```

## Idea 4 - BlockSparse/QN-Inspired Sparse Channel Routing

ITensors.jl has QN and BlockSparse tensors, where tensor blocks are present only when index-sector constraints allow them. SAINT-G can use this as a design analogy for sparse channel routing.

Potential SAINT-G translation:

```text
- partition hidden channels into groups/sectors;
- assign grafts to sectors instead of the full hidden axis;
- discourage overlap between accepted graft sectors;
- use NTK channel scores to identify active sectors;
- track sector collisions across seeds and stages.
```

This connects ITensors.jl and NTK-Mirror:

```text
NTK-Mirror identifies sensitive layer-channel directions.
ITensors suggests representing selected directions as structured sparse sectors.
```

Possible future adapter:

```text
SectorGraftBlock:
  only applies to selected channel groups;
  stores sector metadata in checkpoint;
  composes without touching unrelated sectors.
```

Success signal:

```text
Sector routing reduces interference between grafts and improves seed robustness.
```

## Idea 5 - DRM Transformer Manifold Attention Tensor Anatomy

For `/mnt/e/dev/ai/drm_transformer`, ITensor-style thinking is most useful as an analysis lens.

The DRM Transformer block currently has:

```text
x = x + attn(norm1(x), metric_net, gravity_field, anchors)
x = x + ffn(norm2(x))
```

The attention path contains structured tensors:

```text
- token embeddings x;
- per-head/query/key/value tensors;
- manifold coordinates;
- metric G(x);
- anchor coordinates;
- gravity terms;
- attention logits and probabilities.
```

### Proposed DRM Diagnostic

```text
DRM Marco A - Manifold Attention Tensor Anatomy
```

### Scope

Add an offline analysis script in the DRM Transformer repo:

```text
scripts/analyze_manifold_attention_tensor_anatomy.py
```

Inputs:

```text
--checkpoint /mnt/e/dev/ai/drm_transformer/checkpoints/.../final.pt
--data-dir /mnt/e/dev/ai/drm_transformer/data/multilingual_125m
--device cuda
--batches N
--seq-len 128
--output-dir /path/to/drm_tensor_anatomy
```

Outputs:

```text
tensor_anatomy_metrics.json
layer_head_spectra.jsonl
rank_summary.csv
results.md
```

### Tensor Views to Analyze

```text
[layer, head, token, manifold_dim]
[batch * token, head * manifold_dim]
[token, token, head]
[layer, head, token, token]
[layer, token, anchor]
```

### Metrics

```text
- effective rank by layer/head;
- singular spectrum of attention logits/probabilities;
- compressibility of manifold coordinates;
- rank of metric-induced transformations;
- correlation between gravity terms and attention rank;
- layer/head redundancy;
- whether late layers use higher-dimensional structure than early layers.
```

### Why This Matters

If DRM's geometric attention is low-rank or sectorized, it can guide:

```text
- cheaper inference kernels;
- targeted graft placement;
- better pruning/routing features;
- compression of metric/gravity modules;
- selection of which layers deserve SAINT-G growth.
```

## How NTK-Mirror and ITensors.jl Fit Together

The two repos point at complementary forms of structure:

```text
NTK-Mirror:
  local activation/channel sensitivity and cheap forward-pass adaptation.

ITensors.jl / ITensorMPS.jl:
  global tensor factorization, contraction cost, low-bond-dimension structure,
  and truncation-error accounting.
```

In SAINT-G terms:

```text
4M/4N answer: where should adaptation happen?
4O-lite answers: how much rank/capacity did useful adaptation need?
4O answers: can that capacity be represented more cheaply as TT/MPS?
```

A future combined routing score could look like:

```text
candidate_score = composed_gain
                + alpha * normalized_ntk_sensitivity
                + beta  * compressibility_prior
                - gamma * estimated_cost
                - delta * overlap_with_existing_grafts
```

## Recommended Order of Work

Do not interrupt active Marco 4M seed runs. The recommended order is:

```text
1. Finish Marco 4M seed 42 and inspect ntk_activation_probe_metrics.json.
2. Run Marco 4M for seeds 7 and 123 if seed 42 output is interpretable.
3. Decide Marco 4N mode:
   - ntk_prefilter if NTK ranking is strongly predictive;
   - ntk_score_blend if NTK ranking is useful but not decisive;
   - diagnostic-only if NTK ranking is noisy.
4. Implement Marco 4O-lite Graft SVD Anatomy.
5. If grafts are compressible, implement Marco 4O TT/MPS Adapter Baseline.
6. In parallel or later, run DRM Marco A tensor anatomy on drm_transformer.
```
