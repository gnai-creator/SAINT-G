# Phase 16 Marco 4O - TT/MPS Adapter Baseline

Status: **implemented and smoke-executed on CUDA for seed 42, chi 2/4/8/16**.

## Objective

Marco 4O tests whether a PyTorch-native Tensor-Train / MPS-style adapter can replace dense graft blocks under the existing validation-routed staged protocol.

The motivation came from the 4O-lite SVD anatomy result: accepted dense graft products looked low-rank-like, so the next controlled experiment was not to truncate existing grafts blindly, but to train an explicitly structured adapter family.

## Implementation

New adapter module:

```text
saint/adapters/drm_grafting_tt_adapter.py
```

Implemented components:

```text
TTLinear
TTGraftBlock
make_tt_graft_blocks
```

The adapter uses a projected tensorized bottleneck:

```text
x -> project_down -> TT/MPS core transform -> project_up -> residual add
```

This avoids requiring the DRM `d_model` axis itself to factor conveniently.

The existing routed/staged benchmark now accepts:

```text
--adapter-type tt_mps
--tt-adapter-width 128
--tt-bond-dim {2,4,8,16}
```

and reuses the same candidate grid, stage acceptance, recomposition, and checkpoint protocol as dense graft blocks.

## Results

| chi | adapter_width | params/graft | checkpoint bytes | base_loss | composed_loss | gain | accepted_grafts | recompose_abs_diff |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

All four smoke runs rejected stage 1. The best candidate in each run had zero composed gain, so no TT/MPS graft group was accepted.

## Interpretation

Marco 4O passes the infrastructure requirement:

```text
- PyTorch-native TT/MPS adapter implemented;
- adapter integrated into the existing routed/staged benchmark;
- checkpoint recomposition remains exact for the smoke runs;
- bond-dimension sweep generated reproducible CUDA artifacts.
```

It does **not** pass the modeling success criteria in this smoke configuration:

```text
- no positive validation gain;
- no accepted grafts;
- no evidence of fifth-graft recovery;
- no evidence yet that lower checkpoint bytes compensate for loss.
```

The likely bottleneck is not checkpoint/recomposition mechanics. The smoke configuration used a small `adapter_width=128`, short candidate probes, and conservative learning rates. Compared with the dense 4N-B run, this tests the structured-adapter mechanism but not its full capacity.

## Verdict

Marco 4O is **implemented and technically valid, but negative in the first seed-42 smoke sweep**.

The current result supports this conclusion:

```text
TT/MPS adapters are now a runnable baseline family, but chi 2/4/8/16 at width 128 did not improve the 5M checkpoint under the short routed/staged protocol.
```

## Recommended Next Marco

Run a capacity-check follow-up before discarding TT/MPS adapters:

```text
Marco 4O-B - TT/MPS Capacity Sanity Sweep
```

Recommended changes:

```text
- test adapter_width 256 and 512;
- keep chi 4/8/16;
- increase candidate_probe_steps from 40 to at least 200-500;
- use max_stages 1 first to isolate stage-1 learnability;
- compare against a dense graftblock with approximately matched trainable parameters;
- only run multiseed if stage-1 gain becomes positive.
```

If 4O-B also gives zero gain, move on to cost-aware dense graft routing rather than deeper TT/MPS work.
